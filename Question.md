# Cryptography Question

You've intercepted a mysterious weather station transmission. The message is real, but its meaning is buried beneath layers of encryption.

" Begin where letters dance in glass,
A mirrors trick to let it pass.

Then take a step , not large, just one,
To shift the code before you're done.

To find the key for turning gears,
Search the tool that tracks what the sky folk fear.

Not vane, nor scale, nor gust it notes,
But every drop of rain it quotes.

The wind returns, but not the same,
It twists the key, rewrites the game.

Then final gears clicks one more time,
13 steps will cracks the rhyme. "
